Similar peritoneal carcinomatosis with deposits along the lower anterior abdominal wall and numerous rectus muscle soft tissue deposits.  4.  Redemonstration of metastatic disease involving the ovaries (Kruckenberg tumor), with primary ovarian neoplasm with hepatic metastases also a consideration. The left ovary is slightly increased in size from prior exam, also suspicious for tumor involvement. 5.  Interval resolution of dependent groundglass opacities of the lung bases.\n",

Active extravasation originating from the celiac artery extending into the left pleural space, with retroperitoneal hemorrhage extending inferiorly to the left psoas muscle, as described above. There is also an associated large left hemothorax, which is further described on concurrent CT chest. 2.  Comminuted right posterior wall acetabular fracture. Acute fractures of the bilateral L1 and left L2 transverse processes. 3.  Atrophic right kidney with mild proximal hydronephrosis, possibly secondary to congenital UPJ obstruction 4.

Apparent enhancing soft tissue filling defect within the right lower pole renal collecting system with wall thickening and ill-defined soft tissue extending along the proximal right ureter, concerning for urothelial malignancy. There is also wall thickening and surrounding stranding along the right mid ureter, which may represent malignancy versus infection/inflammation.

Punctate foci of arterial enhancement in the right lower quadrant with hypoenhancing bowel also likely reflect bowel injury/infarction.  Surgical consultation is recommended. 2.  Punctate foci of arterial enhancement in the right psoas, likely reflect active extravasation. 3.  Left L3-5 transverse process fractures.
